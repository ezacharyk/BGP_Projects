# HaxeFlixel Conversions: Beginning Game Programming

This project is a repository HaxeFlixel conversions of the projects, tutorials, and games created in the book "Beginning Game Programming" by Michael Morrison. 

This book was written as an introduction to creating game engines using C++. The goal of this project is to take the project code from that book and convert it to HaxeFlixel.

The code will be made freely available to the public under the MIT open source license.
